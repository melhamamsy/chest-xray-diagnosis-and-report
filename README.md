* **Support Devices:**
Meaning: Refers to medical equipment used to support bodily functions or monitor patients. This can include ventilators, oxygen masks, pacemakers, and other devices.

* **Pleural Effusion:**
Meaning: The accumulation of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs. It can cause difficulty breathing and chest pain.

* **Lung Opacity:**
Meaning: An area on a chest X-ray or CT scan that appears denser than normal lung tissue, indicating the presence of a substance other than air, such as fluid, infection, or tumors.

* **Atelectasis:**
Meaning: A condition in which part or all of a lung becomes airless and collapses. It can result from blockage of the air passages or pressure from outside the lung.

* **Cardiomegaly:**
Meaning: An enlarged heart, which can be detected on imaging studies. It may indicate underlying heart disease, high blood pressure, or other cardiovascular conditions.

* **No Finding:**
Meaning: Indicates that no abnormality was detected on the imaging study. This term suggests a normal result.

* **Edema:**
Meaning: Swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body's tissues. Pulmonary edema specifically refers to fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can make breathing difficult.

* **Pneumonia:**
Meaning: An infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, causing cough, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.

* **Consolidation:**
Meaning: A region of lung tissue that has filled with liquid instead of air. It is often due to pneumonia and can be detected on a chest X-ray.

* **Pneumothorax:**
Meaning: A collapsed lung, which occurs when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall. This can cause sudden chest pain and shortness of breath.

* **Enlarged Cardiomediastinum:**
Meaning: Enlargement of the central compartment of the thoracic cavity, which includes the heart, great vessels, trachea, and other structures. This can indicate various conditions, such as heart disease or tumors.

* **Lung Lesion:**
Meaning: An abnormal area of tissue in the lungs. This can be due to infections, tumors, or other lung diseases.

* **Fracture:**
Meaning: A break or crack in a bone. Rib fractures are common in the context of chest imaging and can result from trauma.

* **Pleural Other:**
Meaning: Other abnormalities or conditions affecting the pleura, the membrane surrounding the lungs. This can include pleuritis (inflammation of the pleura) or pleural plaques.

* **'' (Empty string):**
Meaning: This likely represents an unspecified or unclassified finding in the data. It may indicate incomplete data entry or an unrecorded condition. Mnaually inspected some examples (also passed to ChatGPT), label is changed to **Stable with Minor Abnormalities**.
